http://iselation.com is here as a source to help you pass the time while we are all in self-isolation due to the coronavirus. It's important that we practice social distancing so we can flatten the curve to stop the spread as much as possible. 

That means making a lot of changes to how our every day lives work, and that's not always easy. So we hope by sharing this information we can help make it a little bit better.

On this site you'll find resources for education, entertainment, wellness, and socializing. Everything is open source, and anyone can make a contribution. 

We are using Netlify for hosting so it's a quick deployment as soon as a pull request is opened.
